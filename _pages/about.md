About me
======
My name is Jiaqi Wang, and I am currently a student in a masterâ€™s program in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Silicon Valley. Prior to enrolling in this program, I majored in nursing. I transit into computer science because I would like to combine technology and my health care background to help more people. During my nursing study and internship, I developed a variety of skills necessary for success in the field of Computer Science including strong attention to detail and communication skills. In my MSCS program, I have programmed in Python, Java, and C. I love to solve puzzles with strategic thinking and I am adaptable to changing and unfamiliar environments. I am also able to communicate effectively with others to maintain teamwork. I believe my health care background, combined with the skills I developed in my MSCS program, will make me a valuable contributor to this industry. My current goal is to find a co-op/internship position that will help me gain experience in this field, as I work toward a full-time career in CS.
