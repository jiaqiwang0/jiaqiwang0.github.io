About Me
======
My name is Jiaqi Wang, and I am currently a student in a master’s program in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Silicon Valley.   

I did my internship at Amazon where I built a full stack project utilzing Python Flask, React and AWS services. I got my **[AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/9e3b3b4e-ff39-4637-9f8d-7474319017d6/linked_in?t=rrmgea)** this year.  

In my MSCS program, I have programmed in Python, Java, JavaScript and C. I love to solve puzzles with strategic thinking and I am adaptable to changing and unfamiliar environments. I am also able to communicate effectively with others to maintain teamwork.  

Prior to enrolling in this program, I majored in nursing. I transit into computer science because I would like to combine technology and my health care background to help more people. During my nursing study and internship, I developed a variety of skills necessary for success in the field of Computer Science including strong attention to detail and communication skills. I believe my health care background, combined with the skills I developed in my MSCS program, will make me a valuable contributor to this industry.
